## DESCRIPTION:

A Ruby Class with methods to find usage statistics on a Linux server such as CPU, Disk, TCP/UDP Connections, Load, Bandwidth, Disk I/O, and Memory

## Getting Started

To see an example of usage data run example.rb

Or

Require the library:

```ruby
require './lib/usagewatch_class'
```

Create a new UsageWatch object:

```ruby
u = UsageWatch.new
u.uw_diskused
u.uw_cpuused
u.uw_tcpused
u.uw_udpused
u.uw_memused
u.uw_load
u.uw_bandrx
u.uw_bandtx
u.uw_diskioreads
u.uw_diskiowrites
```

The Class is located at lib/usagewatch_class.rb

## Notes

Disk Used is a sum of all partitions calculated in Gigabytes

CPU Used is a percentage of current CPU being used

TCP/UDP Connections Used is a total count of each respectively

Active Memory Used is a percentage of active system memory being used

Load is the average load of the past minute

Bandwidth is current received and transmitted in Megabits

Disk IO is current disk reads and writes completed per second

## Tested Using
