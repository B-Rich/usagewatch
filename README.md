u = UsageWatch.new
u.uw_diskused
u.uw_cpuused
u.uw_tcpused
u.uw_udpused
u.uw_memused
u.uw_load
u.uw_bandrx
u.uw_bandtx
```

The Class is located at lib/usagewatch_class.rb

## Notes

Disk Used is a sum of all partitions calculated in Gigabytes

CPU Used is a percentage of current CPU being used

TCP/UDP Connections Used is a total count of each respectively

Active Memory Used is a percentage of active system memory being used

Load is the average load of the past minute

Bandwidth is current received and transmitted in Megabits
